# `kemuler`

*this crate is currently in a rapid development phase.*
*~compilation failure will probably be introduced with every 5 commits lol~*
*Update: Current API design is quite stable. But, still, it's in development :P.*


Welcome to `kemuler`!

This crate offers a different kind of high level input simulator framework,
utilizing Rustâ€™s type system to its full potential *(or just over-engineered)*
instead of the usual `key_down(Key)`.

Why? Combinators!

```rust,ignore
use kemuler::prelude::*;
// use a simulator your heart desired
// (your heart must also implement one if there's none)
let mut s = Simulator::new();

// tuple supports
(
    Key::Shift.down(),

    Char('o').click(),
    // down and then up is the same as `.click`
    Char('h').down(),
    Char('h').up(),

    Char('y').click(),
    Char('e').click(),
    Char('a').click(),
    // repeat anything before the `.repeat` 5 times,
    Char('h').click().repeat(5),

    Key::Shift.up(),
)
    // `.seq` wraps the tuple with `Sequence` type to mark it as simulatable
    .seq()
    .run_with(&mut s)
// this typed the message: "OH YEAHHHHH"
```

Currently, there are only a few amount of combinators present.
If you've got some more useful combinator, please submit an issue on [GitHub][kemuler_repo]!

See crate's document for more examples.

# Installation
Using Cargo command:
```sh
cargo add --git "https://github.com/kemuler/kemuler"
```
or add the following to your Cargo.toml dependencies:
```toml
kemuler = { git = "https://github.com/kemuler/kemuler" }
```

Adding `kemuler` on its own wouldn't do anything.
You must import a simulator (means backend) or implements one to actually simulate an input.
Head to [Simulators](https://github.com/kemuler/kemuler#simulators) section to see cooked and ready simulator to be added to your dependencies.

Assuming using `kemuler-enigo` since it's cross-platform.

Using Cargo command:
```sh
cargo add --git "https://github.com/kemuler/kemuler-enigo"
```
or add the following to your Cargo.toml dependencies:
```toml
kemuler-enigo = { git = "https://github.com/kemuler/kemuler-enigo" }
```
